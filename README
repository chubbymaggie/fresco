Welcome to the Berlin windowing system

The current release is 0.1.4, which means it is not even into the stage
where the most adventuresome users will gain any productivity from
it. It's a *developer's* release. If you want to help develop berlin,
you can work off this release with some modicum of confidence and
convenience. 

If you're unpacked the entire source tree, and you meet the prerequisites
(see below) you should be able to run:

$ make CONFIGURE_OPTS='<whatever you want to pass to configure>'

with little difficulty. When (if) the build finishes, you will find
several test applications in the /clients/C++ directory. You must have
omniNames running for any of these to work. 

To try the server after compiling it, you should do something like:

$ export BERLIN_ROOT=.../Berlin
  (where .../Berlin is the directory containing this file, with subdirectories
  src/, include/, etc.)
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BERLIN_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ cd server
$ ./server
  (a black window should pop up; go to another terminal window and set
   BERLIN_ROOT and LD_LIBRARY_PATH there)
$ cd clients/C++
$ ./demo

And you should now be able to play with the spiffy demo.

PREREQUISITES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing has been confined to an extremely narrow environment. The
facilities we build & test with are:

 * linux 2.2.x
 * g++ 2.9 +
 * glibc 2.1.1 & pthreads
 * libstdc++ 2.9 & devel
 * libggi 2.0 beta 2.1 & devel
 * Mesa 3.1 (targetted at GGI) & devel
 * omniORB 2.8.0

(Python demos additionally require omniORBpy and (of course, python);
the Perl demo prerequisites are explained in some detail in
clients/perl/README.)

Please do not hesitate to customize the build process for an
additional platform and send us patches to this tree. If it builds
naked on any configuration other than the above mentionned, please
report this fact to us as well. If you encounter any bugs, please let
us know. This whole process relies on you communicating your
experiences back to the people who wrote it.
