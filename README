Welcome to the Berlin windowing system

The current release is DR1, which means it is not even into the stage
where the most adventuresome users will gain any productivity from
it. It's a *developers* release. If you want to help develop berlin,
you can work off this release with some modicum of confidence and
convenience. 

If you're unpacked the entire source tree, you should be able to run:

For bash:
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib

For csh:
# setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`/lib

# make config
# make

with little difficulty. When (if) the build finishes, you will find
several test applications in the /bin directory. You must have omniNames
running for any of these to work.

Testing has been confined to an extremely narrow environment. The
facilities we build & test with are:

 * linux 2.2.x
 * egcs 1.1.2
 * glibc 2.1.1 & pthreads
 * libstdc++ 2.9 & devel
 * libggi 1.499 & devel
 * Mesa 3.0 & devel
 * ggiMesa
 * omniORB 2.7.1

Currently most development is being done under Debian Linux Potato. You
can update your current Debian machine to get the packages necessary by
doing the following:

If you do not have apt-get, please download it from:
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/slink/main/upgrade-2.0-i386/apt_0.1.8_i386.deb

and run:

# dpkg -i  apt_0.1.8_i386.deb

# cat << __EOF__ > /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib non-free
__EOF__

# apt-get update

This will bring your Debian installation to Potato
# apt-get dist-upgrade

# apt-get install libc6 libgii0-dev gcc g++ omniorb omniorb-dev \
                  libggi2 libggi2-dev mesag3+ggi mesag3+ggi-dev \
                  glutg3+ggi glutg3+ggi-dev libggi-samples \
                  libggi-target-x libstdc++2.9-glibc2.1 libg++272-dev \
                  freetype2 freetype2-dev

# apt-get check
# apt-get upgrade

Please do not hesitate to customize the build process for an
