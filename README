Welcome to the Fresco windowing system

The current release is not even refered to as 'beta', which means it is
not even into the stage where the most adventuresome users will gain any
productivity from it. It's a *developer's* release. If you want to help
develop fresco, you can work off this release with some modicum of confidence
and convenience. Please read the INSTALL file for further instructions about
how to build the system.

Please do not hesitate to customize the build process for an
additional platform and send us patches to this tree. If it builds
naked on any configuration other than the above mentionned, please
report this fact to us as well. If you encounter any bugs, please let
us know. This whole process relies on you communicating your
experiences back to the people who wrote it.

Questions / comments are best directed towards the mailing list:
   devel@fresco.org

Hope you enjoy it
