	* Pointer.cc : Redid the pointer so that it looks like an X
	pointer rather than a blob of colors, and fixed a buglet
	in the directbuffer write loop (write()) which was causing
	the screen update to skip lines, giving a somewhat cool 
	but ultimately broken looking "scanline" effect.

	* GLDrawable.cc: hoisted in some code from the old DBGraphic for
 	initializing GL properly.
