CURRENT GOALS:

1. Generate correct output:
 - draw_image generates awful output when the transformation matrix isn't
   the identity matrix
 - set_font_size does nothing sensible.

2. More testing:
 - produce a DrawingKit testing system of some sort and ensure that all
   functions do what they're supposed to

FUTURE GOALS:

3. Optimize output:
 - common DrawingKit functions should be moved into PostScript functions
 - provide compressed versions of moveto and lineto and compress the file size
 - choose an encoding for images and implement it
