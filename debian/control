Description: A display server based on OpenGL and CORBA
 This is release 0.0.1 of berlin, the long-rumored CORBA display server.
 .
 It is entirely experimental; its current capabilities include a limited
 event handling and forwarding mechanism, and the ability to handle openGL
 calls via CORBA.
 .
 For more information, please see /usr/doc/berlin. It is *strongly*
 recommended that you read what is included there before attempting to run
 the display server.

Description: Berlin's CORBA communications library
 This package includes the interface definition library for berlin. This is
 CORBA's legacy; because of this convention, now any client can operate on
 any host from any host.
 .
 This library is fairly large; from 105k of IDL, this monstrosity came to
 be. To alleviate this there will probably be a port to a different orb in
 the near future.

Description: Modular implementations for the Berlin display server
 Berlin uses CORBA; as such, implementation may be separated from client.
 These are a simple demonstration of that capability. Currently, modules
 are split into two categories: widgets and commands.
 .
 Berlin's widgets are separate from both the client *and* the display
 server; certain other functionality benefits from this capability as well.
