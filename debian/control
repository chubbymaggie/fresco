Description: The Berlin display server
 Berlin is a windowing system derived from Fresco, a powerful structured
 graphics toolkit originally based on InterViews. Berlin extends Fresco
 to a full, network-transparent windowing system that is not based on X.
 It features a rich drawing interface with multiple backends, device
 independent vector based graphics, a Unicode-based text system and is
 3D-aware. It's CORBA-based architecture allow clients in any language
 with corba bindings.
