The tutorial is written in docbook XML. There are a couple of
possibilities to generate useful / readable formats from it.
I recommend Norman Walsh's docbook xsl stylesheets
(http://www.nwalsh.com/docbook/xsl/). To use them, you need
an xslt processor, such as 4xslt (from http://www.4suite.org).
Once you have both installed, you should be able to run 'make'
in this directory and get 'book.html'.
