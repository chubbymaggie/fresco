These are instructions for the configuration, building, and installation
of the Berlin/Fresco windowing system.



Prerequisites
=============

Berlin uses a number of third party libraries, which you will need to
have installed before you can proceed. Please see at

http://www.fresco.org/dependencies.html

for a complete list. Unfortunately, quite a number of them are still
in heavy development, so you may need to get the sources and compile
them yourself. Respective rpm and deb packages may *not* be enough!

You might want to try those packages first. There are even some debian
packages of Berlin/Fresco, you might want to try those instead of building
it yourself.



Downloading
===========

There are currently three ways to download berlin. You can check out the
sources directly from cvs, in which case you find instructions at

  http://www.fresco.org/cvs.html

or you can download a nightly snapshot from

  ftp://berlin.sourceforge.net/pub/berlin/  (currently broken)

or you can get release packages at

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/berlin/



Configuration and Building
===========================

In case you use the cvs version, you have to step into the toplevel
directory ('Fresco'), and call ./autogen.sh, to generate configure
scripts and helper files.

autogen.sh assumes you are using autoconf 2.53. You might experience
problems with earlier versions.

Decide where to build Berlin, our implementation of the Fresco interfaces,
either inside the source tree (let's refer to this as $berlin-src), or (the
recomended way), in a separate build directory ($berlin-build).
Step into the build directory, and run autobuild.sh:

> cd $berlin-build
> $berlin-src/autobuild.sh

this will set up the build tree and check for the available packages.
Here is a list of the available options:

  --prefix               Set the prefix into which Berlin will get installed.

  --sysconfdir           Set the directory for Berlin's configuration file(s).

  --enable-docs          Build the documentation
                         You will need synopsis (http://www.synopsis.org/)
                         to build the Reference Manuals and XML processing
                         tools (for example: http://www.4suite.org/(

  --enable-tracer        Compile with tracer support
                         This produces tons of debugging output: A big help
                         if you want to debug the server or report
                         bugs.

  --with-orb		 Select the CORBA ORB used by Berlin. This can be
  			 either omniORB or TAO for now.

  --with-omniorb-prefix  Prefix for omniORB
                         Only needed if omniORB is not found automatically.

  --with-omniorb-version omniORB version (3 and 4 supported)
                         Only needed if your ORB version is not autodetected.

  --with-colocation-optimization Make Berlin use colocation optimization if
                         this is supported by the ORB you selected.

  --enable-optimization  Make the compiler use optimization. This might
                         mess up debugging etc.

  --with-freetype-prefix Prefix where freetype is installed (optional)
                         Only needed if freetype is not found automatically.

  --with-ggi-prefix      Prefix for GGI
                         This is only needed if you want the GGI console and
                         the GGI libraries are not found automatically.

  --with-sdl-prefix      Prefix where SDL is installed (optional)
                         This is only needed if you want the SDL console and
                         the SDL libraries are not found automatically.

  --with-directfb-prefix Prefix for DirectFb
                         This is only needed if you want the DirectFB console
                         and the DirectFB libraries are not found automatically.

  --with-art-prefix=PFX  Prefix for libArt
                         This is only needed if you want the libArt DrawingKit
                         and libArt is not found automatically.

  --with-ggimesa-prefix  Prefix for GGIMesa
                         This is only needed if you want to run the GLDrawingKit
                         on GGI (no acceleration!) and GGIMesa is not found
                         automatically.

  --with-mesa-prefix     Prefix for Mesa
                         Only needed if you want to build the GLDrawingKit and
                         have your GL library is not found automatically.

  --enable-jprof   	 enable profiling with the jprof tool
                         This is only needed for people wanting to improve
                         the performance of the server.

  --enable-lclog   	 enable lifecycle logging
                         Another debugging option.

[ Add support for interactive configuration and document the options
  here]

Instead of using autobuild.sh you can manually build everything with
a sequence of commands liek this:

> mkdir $(package)
> cd $(package)
> $(berlin-src)/$(package)/configure --with-some-options
> make && make install

Make sure to build Prague, Babylon, Fresco and Berlin first. Afterwards
any dependencies should be met, so you can build in arbitrary order
from this point on. You will need to build at least Prague, Babylon,
Fresco and Berlin plus either GGI or SDL and one of the Clients. Of course
you can just build everything ;-)

Make sure to install the packages with make install. Packages depending on
others will need them to be installed or their configuration will fail.


Testing and First Steps
=======================

You should now find some libraries in $prefix/lib, modules in
$prefix/module, and binaries in $prefix/bin. If you have choosen a
non-standard prefix (anything but /usr/local/) you will need to tell
the loader where to look for the libraries, and, in case you use the
python environment, tell python where to find the Berlin modules:

csh style:

> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $prefix/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
> setenv PYTHONPATH $prefix/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH

bash-like style:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$prefix/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
> export PYTHONPATH=$prefix/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH

Of course $prefix is the --prefix option (it defaults to /usr/local)
you gave to configure when building.

The berlin server is in $prefix/bin/server, and now you should be
able to start it.

> $prefix/bin/server

and voila! that should start the server.

Of course a berlin server without clients is just a bit more exciting
than a X server without clients (mainly because the "I built all this
myself!" factor). To start a client with the server you need to tell it
its location (starting now the $berlin-build stuff will be assumed)
using the -e (execute) flag:

> bin/server -e bin/demo

The demo program is a set of small applications showing some berlin
possibilities (new demos are welcome!).

In order to run the other C++ demo available, demo3D, you need to pass
some more information to the server. First you need to use a console
with a GLContext extension. You have two options here, use the SDL
console built with 3D support or the GGI console with ggimesa support,
both actived in compile time (Note: installing ggimesa may break you
hardware accelerated 3D setup.  You've been warned). Then you need to
use a 3D capable DrawingKit. The default DrawingKit, LibArtDrawingKit
has no 3D support, so you have to tell Berlin to use another DrawingKit
(namely GLDrawingKit).

In short:

> bin/server -e bin/demo3D -c SDL -d GLDrawingKit

for SDL console or

> bin/server -e bin/demo3D -c GGI -d GLDrawingKit

for GGI console.

(Note: the GGI/Mesa console isn't hardware accelerated, so if you
have a good video card use the SDL console instead).

If you're brave you can check http://www.fresco.org/contrib.html to find
"real" applications to run under Fresco/Berlin (they may be broken, or not,
contact their authors for more information).

Finally here they are other options you may use when invoking the server:

  -l --logger [list of groups to log]: log messages (the special group
                                   'lifecycle' requires configuration
                                   with --enable-lclog)

  -t --tracer :                    trace method calls (requires configuration
                                   with --enable-tracer)

  -p --profiler :                  use jprof profiler (requires configuration
                                   with --enable-jprof)



Troubleshooting
===============

There are a couple of places which are frequently subject to problems.
Please consult the FAQ at

http://wiki.fresco.org/index.cgi/ProblemsWithRunningBerlin
http://wiki.fresco.org/index.cgi/FAQ

Please be sure that third party libraries are correctly installed before
you post about a bug. For example, THE MOST FREQUENT PROBLEM reported
is a broken omniORB configuration.  You need to have the nameserver
configured and RUNNING. A good way to test the nameserver is 'nameclt list'.
This should return no error message and terminate immediantly.

You can work around a broken nameserver now: Start the server with
-R ior to have it export an Initial CORBA Reference that the client can
import. This should look like this:

> bin/server -R ior
Export Reference: FrescoServer=IOR:lots-of-numbers

You can then start the demo by passing the exported reference to the
client:

> bin/demo -ORBInitRef FrescoServer=IOR:lots-of-numbers


Contact
=======

You can get into contact with the developers via IRC (#fresco on
irc.openprojects.net) and via mailinglists (see
http://www.fresco.org/mailinglists.html for details).



Good luck!
