This is the (beginning of) a unit test framework based on qmtest
(see http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest/).

Currently the integration with that tool is lacking though and everything
runs fine without qmtest installed.

To preprocess the C++ test classes you will need to have Synopsis in at
least version 0.6 installed. You can get it at http://synopsis.fresco.org/.
